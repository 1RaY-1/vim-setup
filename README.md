# About
This is my simple vim setup.

# What this script does

If you run [vim-setup.sh](https://github.com/1RaY-1/vim-setup/blob/main/vim-setup.sh), it will do this things:

* Create ```~/.vim/pack/vendor/start/``` and ```~/.vim/colors/``` directories.
* Install [monokai](https://github.com/sickill/vim-monokai) colorscheme by cloning it and moving to ```~/.vim/colors/```.
* Install some other plugins ([nerdtree](https://github.com/preservim/nerdtree), [vim-buftabline](https://github.com/ap/vim-buftabline), [AutoComplPop](https://github.com/vim-scripts/AutoComplPop), [vim-airline](https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline)) by cloning them and moving to ```~/.vim/pack/vendor/start/```.
* Move simple vim config (.vimrc file) to home directory (to use it).
